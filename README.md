# Portfolio Website

## Description
My motivation was to create an aesthetically pleasing and convincing portfolio for me to progress in tech and to expand my knowledge in tech. I wanted to build this to show my employer a sense of my capability, and I hope that it creates a small idea of who I am to my employer. I learned that even though there is a lot of code, you have to learn by implementing CSS as much as possible and to just test it out if I have any questions and use the live server as a guide.

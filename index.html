  <header><h2>About me </h2></header>
  <p>Hi, my name is Alan Jose and I had first developed a love of coding from the age of 14, when I was in 8th grade learning in a coding guide from my substitute teacher. Now that I am older, I wanted to pursue a job in the field and create and implement my own websites to create and put mine and others idea into reality. I chose to learn the specific subjects to understand and implement code in a new and varied fashion.
    However, that does not mean that my job by any means is done or finished, I still have a lot to learn and a lot to develop.
     I am always looking to better myself, whether in code or in real life, and always willing to learn new things, whether in code or in real life. My hobbies aside from coding 
    learning about new thing. Please feel free to come and checkout my projects down below, if you can or if you have an idea or a project that would be interesting, please feel free to contect me.</p>
